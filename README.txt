This application is a GUI tool for documenting code using apple's HeaderDoc. To use this tool, you must have the command line tool "HeaderDoc 8.0" installed on your machine.

HeaderDoc 8.0 Command Line Tool: http://developer.apple.com/opensource/tools/headerdoc.html

HeaderDocGUI is meant to simplify the process of creating documentation. It provides a simple interface for running HeaderDoc tools and saves user presets (like locations of projects).
